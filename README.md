Notebook and data for exercise in course at LTH (BMEN35).

The exercise is about **sparse neural networks and SHAP values** and is divided into two parts:

- Creating a sparse neural network from a graph.
- Analyzing the importance of features using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)

The notebook is structured for Google Colab. You could also create your own python environment and pip install all the necessary packages if you want to run it locally.

**WRITE YOUR NAME IN THE FIRST CELL OF THE NOTEBOOK WHEN YOU HAND IT IN**

All the data files exist in the /data directory. If you're on Colab, download these files from the GitHub repo and upload them to /contents/ in Colab. If you clone the repo and run locally, rename the paths in the notebook appropriately.

I left markdown notes for where you're supposed to do something. Comments are there for your understanding and may contain minor tasks.

Here is an example of a sparse neural network.
